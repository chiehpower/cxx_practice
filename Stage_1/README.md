# Simple notes:

## Day4

Expression = operand + operator

single operand can construct a expression. Operand can be variable, literal, function, or member.

In general, one operator should be combined with two operands.
For example, arithmetic operator can use in `integer` and `floating-point number`, and its results are also being integer or floating-point number.

Equality and relational operator can use in `integer`, `floating-point number`, or `Boolean value`, and its reulst is either true or false.

The `= (equal sign)` belongs to `assignment operator`.

1. while loop
2. for loop
